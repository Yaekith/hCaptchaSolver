# HCaptchaSolver
 A proof of concept c# hcaptcha solver, massive help provided from the original hcaptcha solver by backslash. (https://github.com/backslash/hCaptcha-Solver-2.0) <br >
 I guess you could just say this is a .net port of his creation but also updated for hcaptcha's API changes. <br >
 I'm releasing because yolov3 sucks, you might need to train the AI somehow lol.
